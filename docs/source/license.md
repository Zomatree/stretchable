# License and Credits

**stretchable** is licensed under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
The full license text can be also found in the [source code repository](https://github.com/mortencombat/stretchable/blob/main/LICENSE).

**stretchable** is written and maintained by [Kenneth Trelborg Vestergaard](https://github.com/mortencombat).

It is based on [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy), a flexible, high-performance, cross-platform UI layout library written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Without Taffy, there would be no **Stretchable**, so sincerest greetings goes out to the good folks behind Taffy.

For the documentation, I've been inspired by the style and structure of the documentation of [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/), which is also a much-appreciated dependency of Stretchable.
