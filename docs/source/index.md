# stretchable

**stretchable** is a layout library for Python that enables context-agnostic layout operations using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Possible uses include UI layouts, page layouts for reports, complex plotting layouts, etc.

It implements Python bindings for [Taffy](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/taffy), an implementation of Grid/Flexbox written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It was originally based on [Stretch](https://vislyhq.github.io/stretch/) (hence the name), but has since migrated to use Taffy.
